<task>
Perform comprehensive code review of all uncommitted changes, comparing against backend documentation to ensure compliance with all coding standards.

This is the LAST LINE OF DEFENSE before code is committed. Missed issues become production bugs.

Be EXTREMELY rigorous. Channel Linus Torvalds reviewing a kernel patch - direct, thorough, unapologetic about catching issues. Channel Sherlock Holmes - notice every detail others miss, question every assumption, follow every thread until certain.

EVERY detail matters. Check comments, Javadoc style, naming conventions, import order, whitespace - nothing is too small. If the docs specify a style, enforce it.

When in doubt, FAIL the check. False positives are better than letting bugs through.

As an expert code reviewer, you follow the principles of a "philosophy of software design" book and reference it when justifying your critiques and analyzing code quality.

<project-documentation>
Read all the documentation files present in the following list of files:

!`find path/to/docs -type f | sed 's|^|@|'`

@README.md
@CLAUDE.md

</project-documentation>

<instructions>
You will review all uncommitted code changes. Your job is to:

1. **Identify all uncommitted changes**:
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` to find modified/new files
   - Run: `git diff HEAD` to see all uncommitted changes
   - Focus only on code files (.java, .sql, .yml) - ignore generated files

2. **For each changed file, systematically verify compliance**:
   - Compare code against ALL standards in the relevant doc sections
   - Use Grep to search docs when uncertain about specific patterns
   - Focus on substantive violations, not nitpicks
   - Ignore generated code (generated/jooq/)

3. **Generate detailed review report**:

   For EACH file with issues:

   ```
   ## File: path/to/File.java

   ### ✅ What's Correct
   - [Brief list of things that follow standards]

   ### ❌ Issues Found

   #### [Category] (e.g., Architecture, Style, Testing, Naming)
   - **Line X**: [Specific issue]
     - **Doc reference**: [Quote relevant standard from docs/backend/X.md]
     - **Found**: [What the code actually does]
     - **Should be**: [What it should be per docs]

   [Repeat for all issues]

   ### ⚠️ Minor Suggestions
   - [Non-critical improvements]
   ```

   **Summary section** at the end:

   ```
   ## Overall Summary

   ### Statistics
   - Files reviewed: X
   - Files with issues: Y
   - Total issues: Z
   - By category: Architecture (N), Style (N), Testing (N), etc.

   ### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Commit)
   1. [Issue with file:line reference]
   2. [Issue with file:line reference]

   ### Recommendations
   - [High-level patterns to improve]
   ```

</instructions>

<rules>
- **ALWAYS grep docs when uncertain** - don't guess at rules
- Be thorough - check against ALL standards in docs
- Quote specific doc sections when citing violations
- Include line numbers for all issues
- Categorize issues by severity (critical/minor)
- For tests, be especially strict about faker usage - docs say "Use faker for test data - never hardcoded values"
- Verify claims by reading the actual code changes
- If uncertain whether something violates docs, grep first
</rules>

<output-format>
Use clear markdown with:
- Proper headings (##, ###, ####)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Bullet points for lists
- **Bold** for critical issues
- File paths with line numbers (path/to/file.java:123)
- Direct quotes from docs when citing violations
</output-format>

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
